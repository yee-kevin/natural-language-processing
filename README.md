## Material
### Homework
#### 1. HW1 [Code] - Word Embeddings (Co-occurence matrices/Word2Vec)
Word embeddings are dense vectors that represent words, and capable of capturing semantic and syntactic similarity, relations with other words, etc. This homework uses two methods to learn word embeddings: Count-based (Co-occurrence matrices) and Prediction-based (Word2Vec - CBOW and Skip-gram model).The dataset used is "text8" that consists of one single line of text.

#### 2. HW2 [Code] - CKY parsing algorithm for probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG)
Constituency parsing aims to extract a constituency-based parse tree from a sentence that represents its syntactic structure according to a phrase structure grammar. This homework implements a constituency parser based on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) and evaluate its performance. The dataset used is a version of the “Penn Treebank” released in the NLTK corpora.

#### 3. HW3 [Written] - Language Model, Dependency Parsing, Context Free Grammar, Transition-based Parsing

#### 4. HW4 [Code] - Part 1 (IBM Model 1), Part 2 (Seq2Seq Attention Model)
Part 1: IBM Model 1 using hard and soft expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Part 2: Seq2Seq Attention Model using a Bidirectional-LSTM Encoder and a Unidirectional-LSTM Decoder.
