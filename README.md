## Material
### Homework
#### Homework 1
Word embeddings are dense vectors that represent words, and capable of capturing semantic and syntactic similarity, relations with other words, etc. This homework uses two methods to learn word embeddings: Count-based (Co-occurrence matrices) and Prediction-based (Word2Vec - CBOW and Skip-gram model). The dataset used is "text8" that consists of one single line of text.
